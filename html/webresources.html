                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Zoé, and I am an aspiring software developer currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology. 
                    I am passionate about solving problems using technology, creating user-friendly applications, and building meaningful solutions for real-world challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy learning new programming languages and experimenting with web development. My current focus is on improving my skills in 
                    responsive web design, JavaScript, and C#. I aim to combine my technical knowledge with creativity to craft intuitive software solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy writing poetry, exploring new ideas, and spending quality time with family and loved ones. 
                    I am excited to continue growing as a developer and making a positive impact in the field of technology.
