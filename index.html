                    <strong>Bio</strong><br />
                    I'm currently studying at Bellevue College, wrapping up my second year and graduating this spring. I've been diving deep into the world of technology through my coursework. From programming languages like C# and Python to web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've been building a solid foundation in the field. Alongside my technical studies, I'm also passionate about the intersection of technology and project management, which is why I'm planning to pursue a bachelor's degree in application development followed by a master's in project management. These educational pursuits align perfectly with my career aspirations of becoming a technical project manager, where I can leverage both my technical skills and leadership abilities to drive successful projects and teams forward.
